I am a 20-year-old student living in Cluj-Napoca, currently studying at Babe»ô-Bolyai University in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science. With a deep passion for programming, I devote much of my free time to creating various projects where I explore new concepts and techniques. My enthusiasm for coding drives me to constantly challenge myself and seek innovative solutions in the ever-evolving world of technology.
